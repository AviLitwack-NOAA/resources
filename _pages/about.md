NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox is an overarching portal to various scientific software created by scientists both internal to NOAA and external.  The toolbox is overseen by the NOAA National Stock Assessment Program Modeling team.  This site includes general resources for both developers and users of the toolbox.

- You can check out our github organization and repos under the [Fisheries Integrated Toolbox](https://github.com/noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox)

## FAQ 

### How do I create a NOAA approved GitHub Account? 

For setting up individual accounts, go to Github and create an account with your NOAA email account

User-specific Account info:
- NOAA users must have a GitHub account using their NOAA email
- They must have a photo of themselves associated with the account
- They must use 2-factor authentication
- They can only have NOAA related work under their account

>Note: it is good practice that your GitHub user name for NOAA is FirstLast-NOAA, which clearly identifies it as an NOAA linked account versus a personal account

### What are the guidelines for creating a repo with my NOAA account? 

Repository specific rules:
1. only allow write access to NOAA users
2. all non-NOAA users can only have pull-request access
3. must include a disclaimer in the README 
4. must include specific wording in License
5. must have a “gold standard” backup of the repo (this means that you must have a version of the code backup on a noaa server) 

> Note: Anything you put on the GitHub servers (on a free or paid account) should not contain private or conficential information

### How can I set administrative privileges on my repos? 

One way to have more fine-grain Admin privileges is to create an "organization" in GitHub 
- Repos fall under that org and Github allows more admin ability under organizations
