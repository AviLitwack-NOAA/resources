For each tool or code repository in the Fisheries Integrated Toolbox, there is a standardized [onboarding process](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/FIT-Onboarding-Presentation/). The process helps scientific software developers align their code with standard software development to enable easy collaboration, maintenance, improvement, and system development.

If you would like to host your tool on the NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox, please read through the [onboarding slide deck](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/FIT-Onboarding-Presentation/) for details about our onboarding process, and then fill out one of the below forms for the category that corresponds to your tool. We will review your information and then schedule a meeting to discuss options for tool hosting. See more details on the different tool categories on the [FIT home page](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/).
