For each tool or code repository in the Fisheries Integrated Toolbox, there is a standardized [onboarding process](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/FIT-Onboarding-Presentation/). The process helps scientific software developers align their code with standard software development to enable easy collaboration, maintenance, improvement, and system development.

Please use the contact button to request tool onboarding.
