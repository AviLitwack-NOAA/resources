## How do I create a NOAA approved GitHub Account?

For setting up individual accounts, go to Github and create an account with your NOAA email account

User-specific Account info:
- NOAA users must have a GitHub account using their NOAA email
- They must have a photo of themselves associated with the account
- They must use 2-factor authentication
- They can only have NOAA related work under their account

>Note: it is good practice that your GitHub user name for NOAA is FirstLast-NOAA, which clearly identifies it as an NOAA linked account versus a personal account

## What are the guidelines for creating a repo with my NOAA account?

Repository specific rules:
1. Only allow write access to NOAA users
2. All non-NOAA users can only have pull-request access
3. Must include a disclaimer in the README
4. Must include specific wording in License
5. Must have a “gold standard” backup of the repo (this means that you must have a version of the code backup on a noaa server) 

> Note: Anything you put on the GitHub servers (on a free or paid account) should not contain private or conficential information

## How can I set administrative privileges on my repos?

One way to have more fine-grain Admin privileges is to create an "organization" in GitHub
- Repos fall under that org and Github allows more admin ability under organizations    

## How can I report bugs or suggest enhancements to tools in the toolbox?

See **[Reporting bugs](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/resources/onboarding/contributing/#reporting-bugs)** and **[Suggesting enhancements](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/resources/onboarding/contributing/#suggesting-enhancements)**
