The NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology now has a limited [Posit Connect](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/) instance. In anticipation of this instance, the May 2021 [Fisheries Integrated Toolbox Technical Meeting](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/news/NOAA-FIT-Tech-Meeting/) featured an RStudio (Rstudio is now known as Posit) Connect Demo for those planning to use it. The demo provides an overview of how NMFS scientists can use Connect for:
- Simple shiny app deployments
- Git backed publishing
- Blastula
- Model Deployments
