The NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology now has a limited [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) instance. In anticipation of this instance, the May 2021 Fisheries Integrated Toolbox Technical Meeting featured an RStudio Connect Demo for those planning to use it. The demo provides an overview of how NMFS scientists can use RStudio Connect for:
- Simple shiny app deployments
- Git backed publishing
- Blastula
- Model Deployments
