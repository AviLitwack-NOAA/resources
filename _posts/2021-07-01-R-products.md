Posit Connect is a way to share web applications and interactive documents. Once you’ve written a [Shiny application](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/basics.html), you can either [share your app to run locally](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/deployment-local.html) or make it available to anyone who has a web browser. To make it available via web browser, you can either host the application on your own server or on an RStudio server virtually. Below is a brief overview of the available RStudio products and how they differ. For a more comprehensive comparison see the [comparison on the RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/), [‘Deploying Shiny Apps to the Web,’](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/deployment-web.html) and [‘Hosting and Deployment.’](https://shiny.rstudio.com/deploy/)

> NOAA Fisheries scientists may be able to host their content on the Office of Science and Technology's Connect Server. Please [contact us](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/resources/noaa%20fit/contact/) for more details.

Connect is a publishing platform where you can share Shiny applications, R Markdown reports, dashboards, plots, APIs, and more. Use push-button publishing from the RStudio IDE, scheduled execution of reports, and flexible security policies. Also see the [Connect Demo](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/resources/noaa%20resources/connect/) for NOAA Fisheries to learn how RStudio Connect can be used by NOAA scientists.
