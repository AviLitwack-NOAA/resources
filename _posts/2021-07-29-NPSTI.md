Through the [National Protected Species Toolbox Initiative](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/population-assessments/national-protected-species-toolbox-initiative), NOAA Fisheries is developing quantitative analytical tools that will improve protected species assessments and better analyze impacts from human activities, research and development capabilities, and address critical management concerns.
