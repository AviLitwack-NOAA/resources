Through the [National Protected Species Toolbox Initiative](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/population-assessments/national-protected-species-toolbox-initiative), NOAA Fisheries is developing quantitative analytical tools that will improve protected species assessments and better analyze impacts from human activities, research and development capabilities, and address critical management concerns. 

Some of these tools are hosted in the NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox.
