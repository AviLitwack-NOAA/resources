## Why should you use GitHub? 

### Personal Use

#### Organization

[Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-repositories) or 'repos' are like directories for your code or project 
- Can be public
  - Code you might want other people to see, to be able to share code / [collaborate]()
- Or private 
  - Example: can keep everything from a manuscript you’re writing in a repo

#### [Version control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) - tracks changes you make to your code 

GitHub will track all the changes you make, and you can go back and view these changes 
- Many ‘workflows’ for setting this up this 

### Collaboration

#### Share code

People can see your code and copy it 
- Copy it directly to their computer by downloading a `.zip` file or [‘cloning’](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository)
- You can also ‘fork’ a repository to have your own repository on GitHub that keeps up with changes to the owners repo (see more about forking below) 

Get input from others 
- People can [‘fork’](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) a repository, make changes, and then open a [‘pull request’](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
  - Essentially you are ‘suggesting a change’ to the code, website, etc. 

Collaborate directly 
- You can [‘add collaborators’](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) to a repository so multiple people can work on it at the same time and you can directly make changes and see who made changes - again, version control tracks all of these changes

## GitHub Vocab 

**Repositories** contain all of your project's files and each file's revision history
**Clone** a repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between two locations 
**Fork** a repository to make a copy and freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project
**Branch**
**Pull / Pull request** lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository
**Commit **
**Push **
