## The NOAA FIT Code of Conduct

The [NOAA FIT Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/Resources/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

### Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at fisheries.toolbox@noaa.gov or to report anonymously, use [this form](https://forms.gle/iNnmZFS9vwy29gb49).

### Using the NOAA Fit Code of Conduct in your own work

NOAA Fisheries affiliates may link the NOAA FIT Code of Conduct in their own software projects to use as the project's Code of Conduct.

In addition, a [template reporting form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1o9kIyc7oSejkWDQtOYgMdcTI4MSzspgrKrHgjpe_d_Y) is available for NOAA Fisheries affiliates to copy in order to create their own reporting form.
