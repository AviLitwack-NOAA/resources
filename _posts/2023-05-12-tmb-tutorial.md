Template Model Builder (TMB) is a statistical computing platform that performs maximum likelihood inference and is easily extended to include random effects. Models are written in C++ and run with R using the TMB R package. TMB is a successor to ADMB (ADMB will be ending support in Spring 2024).

Beginner and Intermediate TMB trainings were offered at the National Stock Assessment workshop in 2023, and the [online resources](https://nsawtraining.github.io/TMBtraining/) can be used as a self-guided tutorial.
